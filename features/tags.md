# Tag list

The list of tags is needed in order to organize the tags and prevent the addition of non-unique tags.
Tags will not allow you to run all the tests at once, but only those selected according to the logic you define.
Add tags in alphabetical order to find them quickly.

## Once used tags

These tags are used once, from the name itâ€™s clear why they are needed.

  * @IndexPage

## Reusabled tags

These tags are used repeatedly to attach a feature or script to a specific tag topic. For such tags you need
necessarily a brief description. Tag names should be given in the singular.

  * @CurrencyRate                 - test currency rate
  * @Regression                   - Regression test
